It unifies plan design, benefits, networks, coverage rules, and group-level configuration. It must support both standard PBM plans and the added complexity of specialty drug management and care coordination programs.",

FHIR (e.g., InsurancePlan, Formulary IG, Coverage, PlanDefinition) models plan structure conceptually, but NCPDP provides the operational transaction-level attributes and code sets needed for accurate pricing, routing, and coverage rule execution in pharmacy workflows."
