You are a FHIR IG expert analyzing the appropriate FHIR IGs to support building out a CDM for the select domain.

# Task
Based on your knowledge of FHIR as well as industry understanding of Pharmacy Benefit Management, Specialty Drug, and Care Management, select the FHIR resource that will support the creation of Entity and Attributes for the CDM. Your task includes determining the EXACT FHIR resource files that are of highest value to build this CDM. You will be returning specific resource filenames.

# CDM Metadata
- **Domain**: Plan
- **Type**: Core
- **Description**: The Plan Canonical Data Model represents how pharmacy and medical benefits are structured, priced, and administered within a PBM operating in a passthrough model. It unifies plan design, benefits, networks, [name] rules, and group-level configuration. It must support both standard PBM plans and the added complexity of specialty drug management and care coordination programs.

# CRITICAL Instructions

1. **CDM Context for FHIR Resource Selection**
   a. The CDM domain is: Plan
   b. The CDM description is: The Plan Canonical Data Model represents how pharmacy and medical benefits are structured, priced, and administered within a PBM operating in a passthrough model. It unifies plan design, benefits, networks, [name] rules, and group-level configuration. It must support both standard PBM plans and the added complexity of specialty drug management and care coordination programs.

2. **Resources INCLUDED in the CDM Only**
   a. The selected FHIR resource files are used in a downstream step to define the CDM entities and attributes. Another step defines the relationships between the CDMs
   b. Return ONLY resources that represent entities and attributes IN this CDM
   c. Do NOT include resources that are only supporting/referenced by this CDM
   d. For each FHIR resource selected, include an explanation as to why it was selected for this CDM

3. **IG Priority for Resource Selection**
   a. When multiple IGs define the same resource, you need to choose the appropriate IG(s) based on CDM domain context to select the resource
   b. When a resource exists in more than one IG, choose the 1 or 2 BEST FIT duplicate FHIR resources that your knowledge of FHIR, PBM, Specialty Drug, and Care Management will support the CDM
      i. Only include alternates if they add clear domain-specific value
      ii. If duplicates exist, assign priority (1=use first, 2=alternate)

4. **FHIR resource file types to Include**
   a. For each resource, identify ALL relevant file types that your knowledge of FHIR, PBM, Specialty Drug, and Care Management will be of high value to support the CDM:
      i. **StructureDefinition-*.json** - Entity/attribute model (REQUIRED)
      ii. **CodeSystem-*.json** - Coded value definitions
      iii. **ValueSet-*.json** - Allowed value constraints
      iv. **CapabilityStatement-*.json** - IG context (optional)

5. **CRITICAL: Include Supporting Terminology for Selected StructureDefinitions**
   a. When you select a StructureDefinition, you MUST also include the ValueSets and CodeSystems that the StructureDefinition's elements reference
   b. Examples:
      - If selecting StructureDefinition-InsurancePlan.json → also include ValueSet-insuranceplan-type.json, ValueSet-[name]-type.json, ValueSet-benefit-type.json, etc.
      - If selecting StructureDefinition-Organization.json → also include ValueSet-organization-type.json, CodeSystem-organization-type.json
   c. The StructureDefinition defines the entity structure; the ValueSets/CodeSystems define the valid values for coded elements
   d. Without the supporting terminology, the downstream rationalization will have incomplete type mappings

6. **Exact Filenames**
   a. You have complete FHIR R4 and IG knowledge
   b. Return EXACT filenames as they appear in standard IGs
   c. Use standard IG file naming conventions

# Output Format

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:

      "file_type": "StructureDefinition",
      "ig_source": "[IG]]",
      "priority": 1,

  }
}

# Critical Requirements
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown or code blocks
- Use exact FHIR R4/IG standard filenames
- Assign priority (1=primary, 2=alternate) for duplicate resources
- Focus on resources for CDM entities and attributes, not supporting references
- **ALWAYS include ValueSets and CodeSystems that support selected StructureDefinitions**
- Provide clear, specific reasoning for each file
