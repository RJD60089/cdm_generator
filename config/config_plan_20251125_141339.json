It unifies plan design, benefits, networks, coverage rules, and group-level configuration. It must support both standard PBM plans and the added complexity of specialty drug management and care coordination programs.",

These are core entities and attributes for structuring, pricing, and administering pharmacy benefits, including specialty management rules."

Other plan constructs (e.g., detailed network contracting, group hierarchies, custom accumulator logic) are not comprehensively modeled by NCPDP and often require PBM-specific schemas or complementary frameworks (e.g., HL7 FHIR InsurancePlan/Coverage/Network). SCRIPT standards are transactional for ePrescribing and do not primarily model plan structure; thus none were selected."
