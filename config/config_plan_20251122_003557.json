SCRIPT itself is transactional (eRx, ePA) and not primarily plan-modeling, so it is excluded here. Compared to HL7 FHIR (e.g., InsurancePlan and the US Drug Formulary IG), NCPDP provides pharmacy-specific benefit/price constructs (tiers, UM flags, patient pay breakdowns, accumulator/phase semantics) that are critical to PBM plan modeling, while FHIR offers broader cross-domain plan abstractions that can complement but not replace NCPDP detail for pharmacy benefits."
